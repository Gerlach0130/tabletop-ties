  # TableTop Ties

  ## Description

  Uniting gamers one event at a time! TableTop Ties is an online app for like-minded gamers to find events where they can play their favorite games of various genres such as tabletop or cards. These public/group events will be for specific games and/or locations. Our app utilizes secure accounts with favorite game preferences in profiles. Members can message fellow users to get to know one another as well as coordinate games outside of the established events on our application. "Send a Raven" allows the conversation about games to establish friendships amongst players. Avid gamers can all agree that there is nothing harder than attempting to establish new instances of playing their favorite games especially when you don't have a good way to meet people who want to play the same game. TableTop Ties hopes to change the landscape of gameplay matchmaking for the better.
